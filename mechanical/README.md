CADs can be accessed via [the GrabCad repository](https://workbench.grabcad.com/workbench/projects/gcM8LJ5XvqJ3JSgln1WBvlYX60p0lWjT9AxDCpcW93qWFp#/space/gcLw54yDNadcmLN5UvSljD_vmd5pv6YnSIViViylHwmKnL). The GrabCad repository contains all the latest designs and models in individual part format, as sub-assemblies and finally as a master assembly.

For more information on the device's operation as well as some of the functions of individual components, please consult our [documentation](https://github.com/breeze-ventilator/covid19-ventilator/tree/master/documentation).
