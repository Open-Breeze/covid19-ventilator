#  Breeze Ventilator
Welcome to our open-source, low-cost ventilator design! We are a group of students, physicians and engineers who worked on the design to help alleviate the critical need for ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/5ufh_80dSsk) with an overview of our design.

## Folder Structure
**Mechanical:** Everything you need to construct the device including the bill of materials and the CAD files.

**Software:** Breeze ventilator code including code for both the interface (running on the Raspberry Pi 4) and the firmware (running on the Arduino Mega).

**Electronics:** PCBs and the circuit diagrams.

**Documentation:** Documentation for operating the device including the User Guide and the Assembly guide, which will help you set-up and run your device smoothly.

## Conclusion

The Breeze Ventilator was built during a design sprint and is not ready to be safely used as a functioning ventilator. Nevertheless, we hope that you will find inspiration from our design and that it will help you with your projects!
